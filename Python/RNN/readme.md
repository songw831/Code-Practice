## Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short Term Memory



### This directory contains all the files about RNN with LSTM.

#### You may run these Python files in order as below:

+ **`LabelExtraction.py`** splits the standardized training set and test set. It then extracts the labels separately.
+ **`RNNTrain.py`** reshapes the train and test data fit for the network. Reshaped data are used to train the constructed CNN. Save the model to `myRNNModel.h5`.
+ **`RNNPrediction.py`** loads the model saved and predicts the test data. Finally giving the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.
